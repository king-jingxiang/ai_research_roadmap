# Qwen Series Evolution Report

## 1. Introduction
The Qwen series, developed by Alibaba Cloud, represents a significant leap in open-source Large Language Models (LLMs). Starting from the initial 7B model [2309.00071], the series has evolved to cover various sizes, modalities (Audio, VL), and specialized capabilities (Coding, Math).

## 2. Key Milestones

### 2.1 The Beginning: Qwen-7B
The release of **Qwen-7B** marked the entry of Qwen into the LLM arena. It demonstrated strong performance on standard benchmarks, challenging established models.
Key Paper: [2309.00071]

### 2.2 Visual Understanding: Qwen-VL
Integrating visual capabilities, **Qwen-VL** [2308.12966] expanded the model's horizon to understand images, enabling multi-modal interactions.

### 2.3 Audio Processing: Qwen-Audio
With **Qwen-Audio** [2311.07919], the series embraced audio processing, allowing for speech recognition and audio understanding tasks.

## 3. Future Trends
Based on recent updates, we see a trend towards:
- **MoE Architectures**: More efficient inference.
- **Agentic Capabilities**: Enhanced tool use and reasoning.
- **Unified Modality**: Merging Vision, Audio, and Text into a single omni-model.
